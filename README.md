## Oneâ€‘Line Elevator Pitch

Predict the next 24â€¯hours of bicycle traffic on Boulevard SÃ©bastopolâ€”Parisâ€™s busiest cycling corridorâ€”using automated data ingestion, gapâ€‘aware feature engineering, and an ensemble of statistical and machineâ€‘learning models.

**Problem Statement**

> Boulevard SÃ©bastopol ranks among the highestâ€‘volume bike routes in Paris, yet its traffic patterns are influenced by complex factorsâ€”daily and weekly seasonality, weather, infrastructure works, and special events. This project aims to experiment with different timeâ€‘series modeling techniques, handle significant data gaps, and build an endâ€‘toâ€‘end forecasting pipeline that delivers accurate 24â€‘hour traffic predictions for further exploration and learning.
